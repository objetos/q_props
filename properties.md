# Quadrille properties

The `quadrille` properties are the following:

1. `memory2D`: Array2D: quadrille memory read-write property.
2. `width` Number: quadrille width read-write property.
3. `height` Number: quadrille height read-write property.
4. `size` Number: read-only property that retrieves the quadrille width times the quadrille height.
5. `order` Number: read only property that retrieves the quadrille non-empty number of cells.
6. `mouseCol` Number: Read only property that retrieves the quadrille col under the current mouse position.
7. `mouseRow` Number: Read only property that retrieves the quadrille row under the current mouse position.

These properties are pretty straightforward and its usage is left out as an exercise.
